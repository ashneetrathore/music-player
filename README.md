Based on assignment instructions from Prof. Amir Rahmani

Embedded Music Player is an ATMega32 microcontroller-based system designed to play predefined songs with interactive user controls. The breadboard circuit integrates a speaker for outputting audio, a LCD for displaying song titles, and a keypad for controlling playback, selecting songs, and adjusting pitch and tempo.

## :brain: FIRMWARE DESIGN
Run in **Microchip Studio**, the core software logic of the music player focuses on generating singular music notes at the microcontroller level and combining them to play complete songs. A `PlayingNote` struct represents a single note, storing its pitch and duration, and songs are encoded as arrays of these structs. The `play_song()` function iterates through each struct and calls `play_note()`, which generates sound by toggling a GPIO output pin to produce a square-wave signal at the desired frequency for the specified duration.

**Precise timing** is critical for accurate audio generation, so the program defines an `avr_wait_us()` function that provides fine-grained delay control in units of 8 microseconds, This high-resolution delay is necessary to accurately control the high and low periods (`th` and `tl`) of each waveform cycle, ensuring consistent pitch and tempo during playback.

User input is handled through **polling-based keypad scanning**, allowing the user to start or stop playback, select from three pre-encoded songs - *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star*, *Mary Had a Little Lamb*, and *Birthday Song* — and adjust pitch and tempo in real time. The program updates the song title displayed on the LCD accordingly.

### :toolbox: REQUIRED HARDWARE
- ATMega 32 Microcontroller
- Breadboard (with solid core or jumper wires)
- ATMEL-ICE Programmer
- 9V Battery (with 9V battery connector)
- LCD Display
- 4 by 4 Keypad
- Speaker
- 5V Voltage Regulator
- 2 0.1µF Capacitors
- 8 MHz Crystal
- 1K Resistor

### :battery: BUILDING THE POWER SUPPLY
The voltage regulator has three pins: input (Pin 1), ground (Pin 2), and output (Pin 3). The circuit takes +9V as input and regulates it down to a +5V output, using the capacitor to smooth out the output voltage.
1. Connect the positive terminal of the 9V Battery to Pin 1.
2. Connect the negative terminal of the 9V Battery to Pin 2.
3. Connect the negative (shorter) leg of a capacitor to Pin 2, and the positive leg of a capacitor to Pin 3.
4. Connect Pin 3 to the positive rail of the breadboard and Pin 2 to the negative rail to power one side of the breadboard.
5. Join the two power rails on each side of the breadboard (positive together, negative together) to deliver voltage to both sides.

### :electric_plug: CONNECTING THE PROGRAMMER TO THE MICROCONTROLLER
